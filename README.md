# Sandwich Shop

This is a simple Flutter app that allows users to order sandwiches.
The app is built using Flutter and Dart, and it is designed primarily to be run in a web
browser.

## Install the essential tools

1. **Terminal**:

    - **macOS** – use the built-in Terminal app by pressing **⌘ + Space**, typing **Terminal**, and pressing **Return**.
    - **Windows** – open the start menu using the **Windows** key. Then enter **cmd** to open the **Command Prompt**. Alternatively, you can use **Windows PowerShell** or **Windows Terminal**.

2. **Git** – verify that you have `git` installed by entering `git --version`, in the terminal.
    If this is missing, download the installer from [Git's official site](https://git-scm.com/downloads?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

3. **Package managers**:

    - **Homebrew** (macOS) – verify that you have `brew` installed with `brew --version`; if missing, follow the instructions on the [Homebrew installation page](https://brew.sh/).
    - **Chocolatey** (Windows) – verify that you have `choco` installed with `choco --version`; if missing, follow the instructions on the [Chocolatey installation page](https://chocolatey.org/install).

4. **Flutter SDK** – verify that you have `flutter` installed and it is working with `flutter doctor`; if missing, install it using your package manager:

    - **macOS**: `brew install --cask flutter`
    - **Windows**: `choco install flutter`

5. **Visual Studio Code** – verify that you have `code` installed with `code --version`; if missing, use your package manager to install it:
